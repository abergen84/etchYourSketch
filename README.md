#etch Your Sketch

##Application Description

Remember that cool game growing up called Etch-A-Sketch? If you don't, you weren't
living life to the fullest. Either way, I've created a replica of the simple,
sweet game in React for the user experience. Draw something cool, useless, intricate, 
or straight up awful. The choice is yours. 

##Application Features

- Choose your canvas size (between small, medium, and large)
- Messed up? Hit that descriptive button and have it reset the canvas so you can start over

##Application Stack

Using React in combination with Backbone for a quick weekend project.

- React for the user experience/view
- Backbone to handle the trigger system.
